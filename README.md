##Build a Portfolio and the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

This project is part of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) portfolio. We're including it here so you can complete it independently, for free. The project instructions and rubric you'll get are identical to what Nanodegree students get.

The difference is, you're likely taking this course on your own and aren't getting dedicated support. Of course, that means you will not submit your project to us for evaluation or earn a Nanodegree certificate.

However, you can still use the provided rubric to self-assess your work. Better yet, take this course with a friend, and assess each other's work!

We started the Nanodegree program because we recognize how hard it is to advance your career and learn programming on your own. At the same time, we know there are many of you taking this course for free at your own pace, for your own purposes, and we want (and expect) you to build and do great things. Wherever you are on your journey, stay Udacious and never, ever stop learning.

Have fun with the project!

##How do I Complete this Project?

Here's what you should do:

1. Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section to your lower right hand corner and review it.
2. Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
3. Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
4. Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.

5. Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators. Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:

  - HTML5: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
  - CSS3: Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).

##Evaluation 

This is the rubric that would be used to evaluate your project if you were enrolled in the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. Under those circumstances, all criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.
